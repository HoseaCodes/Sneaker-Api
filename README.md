I have always had an interest in sneakers. In the process of making projects I wanted to make a sneaker application using a 3rd party API but I discovered there weren't any API's or there weren't any that were accessible at the time.

Sneaker API produces JSON data with descriptions, images, prices and release dates of the most popular sneakers. You can make HTTP request to my API to get the JSON data. On the home page you can see some of the sample JSON data if you click the submit button.

## Technologies Used

This application was developed with Node.js, EJS, Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery and styling with CSS.

M - MongoDB to store data  
E - Express, a back-end framework  
EJS - renders client side views  
N - NodeJS - to run back end service

other dependencies used:

- Morgan - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
- Mongoose - for MongoDB validation
