I have always had an interest in sneakers. In the process of making projects I wanted to make a sneaker application using a 3rd party API but I discovered there weren't any API's or there weren't any that were accessible at the time.

Sneaker API produces JSON data with descriptions, images, prices and release dates of the most popular sneakers. You can make HTTP request to my API to get the JSON data. On the home page you can see some of the sample JSON data if you click the submit button.
